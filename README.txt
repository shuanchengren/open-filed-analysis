#Title of code: Code for open field analysis for the article “A midbrain GABAergic circuit constrains wakefulness in stressful challenging conditions”

*Features: MATLAB code for tracking animals’ locomotor activity in the open filed test. This code permits tracking the trajectory of animals in the open field and analyzing the travel speed, distance traveled. 
*Format(s): .mat.
*Size(s): 72kB.
*Instructions: Code was run on MATLAB (2016b) on Windows 10. “MY_MICE_TRACKING_56_GENERALSIZE” is code for generating “my_mice_tracking_56_generalSize.fig”. MY_MICE_TRACKING_56_GENERALSIZE, by itself, creates a new MY_MICE_TRACKING_56_GENERALSIZE or raises the existing. Detailed instructions can be found in the scripts.
